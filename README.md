Build an app that makes apps with Expo Router! Also functions as a React website that generates React websites!

Use [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) with [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/getting-started/expo) and [Nativewind](https://www.nativewind.dev/v4/overview/) styling.

â—† Builds websites and native apps
â—† 100% code sharing
â—† Fully streamed responses
â—† Auto installs missing dependencies
â—† Supports swapping AI models
â—† DOM components for code blocks
â—† React Server Actions for bundling

## ðŸš€ How to use

Add an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) to `.env`:

```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
```

Finally you can start the app with `npx expo`.

## Deploy

> This project uses the local Metro bundler to evaluate React code, this won't work in production without a remote Metro instance running.

Ensure you set the `EXPO_UNSTABLE_DEPLOY_SERVER=1` environment variable to enable [parallel deployments](https://docs.expo.dev/router/reference/api-routes/#native-deployment) to the server.

Deploy on all platforms with Expo Application Services (EAS).

- Deploy the website: `npx eas-cli deploy` â€” [Learn more](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/hosting/get-started/)
